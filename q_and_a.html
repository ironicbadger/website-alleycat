      <h6 class="mb-3 text-primary"><i class="far fa-paper-plane text-primary pe-2"></i>Where do you teach?</h6>
      <p>
        I teach in my home. I have a designated music room at the front of the house, right by the front door. Parents who choose to wait in their cars can see in through the windows at the front. 
        After 8pm I am willing to travel to close locations to teach students in their home for an extra $5 fee per lesson. I also teach students online, I've had students take their lessons on vaction with them and continue lessons from the beach or the Swiss Alps!

      <h6 class="mb-3 text-primary"><i class="fas fa-pen-alt text-primary pe-2"></i>How do I pay?</h6>
      <p>
        I accept payment through check, cash, venmo or paypal. You can pay weekly at each lesson or pay for 4/10 lessons upfront. Standard 30 minute lessons for one student are $35

      <h6 class="mb-3 text-primary"><i class="fas fa-user text-primary pe-2"></i>What if I need to skip a week?
      </h6>
      <p>
        If you can't make your usual lesson time please reach out to me as I can probably rearrange it to another day or time. <br> There is no obligation to have a lesson every week. Most people do because it helps keep them accountable. But you can have lessons every 2 weeks, every month or on an ad hoc basis too. <br> If you do need to cancel please give me as much notice as possible: I organize childcare etc. around my teaching schedule. <br> If you no show a booked lesson or a weekly recurring lesson without letting me know I will unfortunately still need to charge you for the lesson.
