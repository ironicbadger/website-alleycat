      <h6 class="mb-3"><i class="far fa-paper-plane text-primary pe-2"></i>Where do you teach?</h6>
      <p>
        I teach in my home. I have a designated music room at the front of the house, right by the front door. Parents who choose to wait in their cars can see in through the windows at the front. 
        I also teach students online, I've had students do online full-time or just occasionally take their lessons on vaction with them and continue lessons from the beach or the Swiss Alps!

      <h6 class="mb-3"><i class="fas fa-home text-primary pe-2"></i>What length lesson do you recommend?
      </h6>
      <p>I usually recomend 30 minute lessons for most people. More advanced students will often need 45 mins or an hour as well as very motivated adult and teenager beginners.</p>

      <h6 class="mb-3"><i class="fas fa-pen-alt text-primary pe-2"></i>How do I pay?</h6>
      <p>
        I accept payment through check, cash, venmo or paypal. You can pay weekly at each lesson or pay for 4/10 lessons upfront. Standard 30 minute lessons for one student are $35.

      <p>
        <li>Yourself!</li>
        <li>All your music, even books that you don't have a piece from this week as I might want to assign one!</li>
        <li>If you're a wind player remember - your instrument, reeds (with spares), neck strap/seat strap if you use one</li>
        <li>A pencil</li>
        <li>A NOTEBOOK</li>

      <h6 class="mb-3"><i class="fas fa-user text-primary pe-2"></i>What if I need to skip a week?
      </h6>
      <p>
        If you can't make your usual lesson time please reach out to me as I can probably rearrange it to another day or time. <br> There is no obligation to have a lesson every week. Most people do because it helps keep them accountable. But you can have lessons every 2 weeks, every month or on an ad hoc basis too. <br> If you do need to cancel please give me as much notice as possible: I organize childcare etc. around my teaching schedule. <br> If you no show a booked lesson or a weekly recurring lesson without letting me know I will unfortunately still need to charge you for the lesson.

      <h6 class="mb-3"><i class="fas fa-rocket text-primary pe-2"></i> How can I help my child/myself succeed?
      </h6>
      <p>
        <strong>Practice</strong> 
        <li>Little and often. It's better to practice four times a week for 15 minutes than once for an hour.</li>
        <li>Try to practice everyday if you can!</li>
        <li>Don't always play the whole piece. Practice just the tricky bits</li>
        <li>Practice slowly and accurately. Practice makes ..... PERMANENT</li>
        <li>Don't forget scales and exercises</li>

    <div class="col-md-6 col-lg-4 mb-4">
      <h6 class="mb-3"><i class="fas fa-book-open text-primary pe-2"></i>How long should I expect my child/myself to take lessons?</h6>
      <p>
        Students usually take lessons for at least a few years! Experts think that it takes 8 - 10 years to become fully proficient in playing an instrument! That being said, I have had students go on to major in music after taking up an instrument in middle or high school. Many students enjoy having lessons until they have the basics down and then happily stop lessons and play for their own pleasure at that level. You don't need to reach expert level to have fun playing music.
