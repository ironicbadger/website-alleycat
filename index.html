        <h1>About me</h1>

              <h4>Hi! My name is Catherine Kretzschmar.</h4>
              <p>I teach music to students aged 3 and up, including adults, at my home in North Raleigh, NC and online. Lessons are offered on Piano, Voice, Saxophone, Bassoon and Clarinet. To see my availability via Calendly <a href="schedule.html">click here.</a><br /><br />
              I'm originally from the UK, and have been playing music in one form or another since I was a little girl. I studied at two music conservatoires in England: Guildhall in London and the RNCM in Manchester. During that time I studied bassoon and baroque bassoon, attaining a masters degree in solo performance. After that I completed a post-grad teaching certificate.<br /><br />
              Although bassoon is my first instrument, I am also a proficient clarinet player, pianist and singer.<br /><br />
              I have worked as a freelance musician in the UK and Europe, including touring with the European Opera Centre and a summer residency with the Dartington Festival Orchestra, Baroque Orchestra and Chamber Ensemble.<br /><br />
              As a teacher I am friendly and smiley, I think music lessons should be the highlight of your week! I can change my lessons to fit you or your child, we can do any style and it can be as fun or as challenging as you wish. In the past I have taught everything from adult beginners who just want to have some fun and get good enough to join a local band to teenagers studying music at a high standard, taking exams and performing regularly.<br /><br />

I look forward to my lessons each week, even if I haven't practiced as much as I should! I look forward to my continued growth as a musician and appreciate Catherine for always making it fun"</p>

            <div class="card-body">
              <p class="card-text">First of all, I want to say that I love my Clarinet teacher - she's amazing!!

                Catherine and I have been on a wonderful musical journey together, and it was the together part that's made it wonderful.   
                
                In March 2017 I decided I wanted to learn the Clarinet because it was my dream to play in an Orchestra or Wind Band, or at least, with other people.  The Clarinet is a nice, portable and versatile instrument.  It lends itself equally to Classical, Jazz or Marching Bands. I never wanted to play any solos (and unlike Oboeists or flute players) Clarinet players can choose to avoid solo parts in performances (if they want to). ðŸ˜€
                
                So I bought myself a blue, plastic, Bb Clarinet from Amazon and called Catherine for my very 1st lesson.  Despite, no doubt, being a bit taken aback by my Clarinet's colour, Catherine led me through assembling the instrument & choosing and fitting the right kind of reed. She has taught me how to read music and, at my request, music theory.
                
                I looked forward so much to my weekly lessons.  Catherine was always so kind and patient despite the squeaks and squawks I made on the instrument at times and we always had fun.
                
                Catherine is incredibly proficient at playing Clarinet, Bassoon and Piano.  If you are lucky enough to live near her for in-person lessons, she will accompany you beautifully on the piano or play a duet with you if you wish. 
                
                Catherine emigrated to the USA a few years ago, but I was unwilling to lose her kind and very helpful tuition, so we have continued with weekly Skype lessons from the UK (or Switzerland if I happen to be there).
                
                After 4 or 5 years of tuition, and lots of practice on my part, I reached my goal of join an Orchestra and a Wind Band.  It was a big challenge to keep time correctly playing in a Band but again Catherine helped me by giving me lots of practice in my Band pieces.  I'm so happy to have this opportunity and to perform with other 'Musicians'.  All thanks to my great teacher.
                
                Thanks Catherine xx</p>
