            <div class="About-Me">
              <p>I'm originally from the UK, and have been playing music in one form or another since I was a little girl. I studied at two music conservatoires in England: Guildhall in London and the RNCM in Manchester. During that time I studied bassoon and baroque bassoon, attaining a masters degree in solo performance. After that I completed a post-grad teaching certificate.<br /><br />
              Although bassoon is my first instrument, I am also a proficient clarinet player, pianist and singer.<br /><br />
              I have worked as a freelance musician in the UK and Europe, including touring with the European Opera Centre and a summer residency with the Dartington Festival Orchestra, Baroque Orchestra and Chamber Ensemble.<br /><br />
              As a teacher I am friendly and smiley, I think music lessons should be the highlight of your week! I can change my lessons to fit you or your child, we can do any style and it can be as fun or as challenging as you wish. In the past I have taught everything from adult beginners who just want to have some fun and get good enough to join a local band to teenagers studying music at a high standard, taking exams and performing regularly.<br /><br />
